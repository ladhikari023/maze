In order to run the program, you need to provide the configuration for the file. You can do this by going to run>Edit configuration and once you are there, you need to provide the program arguments, which should be a relative path to the file you read. The file will follow the format as provided in the project4.pdf file on Learn. We distributed our project as following:
Laxman Adhikari- 
Generator-
a. Depth First Search (DFS)
b. Prims

Solver- 
a. Wall follower
b. Wall Follwer with multi-threading

Shaswat Shukla-
Generator-
a. Aldous
b. Kruskal

Solver-
a. Random Mouse
b. Pledge Solver

Laxman did the 'maze' package and the Maze solver abstract class, whereas Shaswat did the 'gui' package and the 'utility' package.
Even though we listed our individual contribution above, we did get help from each other on most of the code and most of the code is combined work of each other. Also, we already emailed Joe about how we had to delete the project on LoboGit on Tuesday because of some problems in merging our code, so we had to create a new project on Tuesday and that's why you won't see Git commits from before Tuesday. 

Unfinished Feature:
Lightning Algorithm: We couldn't complete lightning algorithm. We have implemented pledge algoritm for solving maze, other than the mandatory generation algorithm. 
Extra credit- Aldous Maze Generator has been done.
